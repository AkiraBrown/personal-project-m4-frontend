## Vroom App (Frontend)

This is the frontend of this application that displays 100 cars
in a card format. These cars can be filtered through by manufacturer, edited and deleted accordingly. The user can also create a new car entry, which has quite an extensive form. On successful submission,
a 'modal' appears to alert to the user and further details are presented on the Home page.
